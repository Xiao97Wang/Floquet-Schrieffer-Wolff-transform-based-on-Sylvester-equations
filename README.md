# Floquet-Schrieffer-Wolff-transform-based-on-Sylvester-equations

Here I provide the codes for simulating the Return rate dynamics for the PRB paper: Floquet Schrieffer-Wolff transform based on Sylvester equations

These 3 codes simulates the return rate predicted by 3 methods: the exact time-dependent TEBD, the lowest order HFE stroboscopic Hamiltonian dynamics, and the lowest order FSWT stroboscopic Hamiltonian dynamics



The FSWT Hamiltonian is defined in the code, please use it for future follow up works or re-checks
